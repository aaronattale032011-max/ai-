Day 1 — Starting: What is AI (Artificial Intelligence)

Definition AI is machines with human intelligence — systems that can learn, reason, and make decisions.

Subfields of AI

- Machine Learning (ML): The process of learning from past data or experiences.
- Deep Learning (DL): Learning and improving through neural networks.
- Data Science: Using data to analyze, visualize, and make predictions.

"What is AI" – Simplilearn

- Making computers think.
- Weak AI: Can perform specific or simple tasks (e.g., Siri, chatbots).
- Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): Machines with human-level intelligence.
- Artificial Superintelligence (ASI): Systems that surpass human intelligence.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Enables machines to understand and respond to human language.
